# Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis
This is the repository for the Machine Learning project "Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis". In this project, we use data science and machine learning techniques to predict the presence of kidney stones based on physical characteristics of urine samples.

## Introduction
Problem Summary
Kidney stones are a common condition that can cause severe pain and complications if not detected and treated promptly. The formation of kidney stones could be related to certain physical characteristics of urine. The challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of kidney stones based on these characteristics.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of urinalysis results from 79 urine samples that were analyzed to determine whether certain physical characteristics of urine could be associated with the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, a common type of kidney stone. The data were obtained from the chapter "Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals" in the Springer Series in Statistics.

### Dataset Features
The dataset includes six physical characteristics of urine:

- Specific gravity: Expressed as a ratio between the density of a substance (in this case, urine) and the density of a reference substance (usually water).

- pH: The negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion.

- Osmolarity: A unit used in biology and medicine that is proportional to the concentration of molecules in solution.

- Conductivity: Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged ions in solution.

- Urea concentration in millimoles per liter.

- Calcium concentration in millimoles per liter.

- Target: The presence or absence of kidney stones.

### Methodology
To approach this problem, we follow these steps:

- Data Preprocessing: We will clean and prepare the data for analysis. This might include outlier removal, missing value imputation, and data normalization.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will explore the data to better understand the relationships between the features and the presence of kidney stones.

- Feature Selection: We will identify the most important features for kidney stone prediction.

- Modeling: We will train several machine learning models and select the one that provides the best performance or use model stacking
